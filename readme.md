# Project Overivew
This project was initially created following the [Justin Kim's Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzhcb4M9-0Q) as an exercise in HTML, CSS, and JS. 
As I continue to work with this project, I plan to add code for a computer opponent and customize the game appearance.
